# Calculators
Designing a calculator for every coding language possible on the web

# The Goal
Through my studies of coding languages i have come to realize that just about every coding langauage no matter how different the syntax can handle user input and variables and produce and output. With this being said i wanna make an interactive calculator for each coding language and then advance on each one and see which language can produce the best calculator!

# Contributing
Please feel free to contribute to this project as I do not know all languages and will not be able to complete in a timely manner without help
